we are developing an AI-driven cardiac arrhythmia detection system that analyzes ECG signals to identify abnormal heart rhythms such as bradycardia, tachycardia, ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation (A-fib), and A-fib with tachycardia. The model will leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques, along with biomedical signal processing libraries such as NeuroKit, to extract relevant ECG features by detecting peaks, intervals, and waveform patterns. These extracted features will be classified using trained models to determine the specific type of arrhythmia present. Additionally, the system will be designed to provide medically validated recommendations
